                    <h1>About</h1>

                    <p>
                        Dungeoneer has been in development since early 2017, when I started upgrading from my old Excel sheet. I created a basic app to make my life a little bit
                        easier and my games more efficient. It's main function was to be a convenient place to look up rules and monsters (SRD and homebrewed), and to keep track of
                        initiative and HP in combat.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since then I've added a few things, mainly tools to generate things such as treasure, NPC's and stuff, as well as an integrated mapping tool which allows
                        you to efficiently maintain the visual component of running combats, usually on a projected screen or TV.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What this app does is make life easier for the GM and keep the game running smoothly. It's not a place where you should keep exstensive notes, but rather a
                        set of convenient tools that help you improvise things and run combat without hassle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app is entirely free to use and distribute non-commmercially. Some of the icons were grabbed from
                        <a href="https://game-icons.net/">game-icons.net</a>. You can change or build upon it if you'd like. See

                            style="width: 400px"
                            alt="The top right searchbar (fig. 1.1) allows you to search for any monsters in the SRD, homebrew monsters or encounters you have created. The results will displayed in the window below (fig. 1.2).

                        />

                        The top right searchbar allows you to search for any monsters in the SRD, or homebrew monsters and encounters you have created. The results will displayed
                        in the window below.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pressing the add button inside the displayed statblock will add the creature or encounter into the combat panel.</p>
                    <p>
                        The combat panel has basic combat stats of a creature, as well as a dice roller for attacks. Pressing the creature's name will toggle a more detailed view,
                        including a log of applied damage and healing
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pressing the Apply button will apply damage from the leftmost field. For healing, use negative numbers. If the creature's hit points drop to 0 or less, it
                        will be removed from the panel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pressing the D20 button will roll an attack for the creature, adding the current attack's modifier to the roll result. If it equals or execeeds the value in
                        the VS AC field, the D20 will turn green, indicating a hit. In the case of a critical hit, the die will turn red. If the attack hits, damage is
                        automatically rolled (dice are doubled in the case of a crititcal hit) and displayed in the rightmost field.
                    </p>
                    <p>If the creature has multiple attacks, you can switch between them by pressing the leftmost field.</p>
                    <img src="screenshots/1.2.JPG" class="img_right" alt="Pressing the creature's name will toggle a more detailed view for that row." />
                    <p>The clear (C) button will delete everything from the combat panel.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Maptool (M) button will open the maptool, allowing you to add the creatures from the combat panel to the map tool. If the creatures have tokens saved,
                        those tokens are automatically loaded. If a creature is killed in the maptool (by using Kill from the pawn context menu) it will be removed from the combat
                        panel. Likewise, if it's hit points drop to 0 or less in the combat panel, it will be displayed as dead in the map tool.

                    <p>Dungeoneer can keep track of the basic information for player characters. Press the Party button in the top left corner.</p>
                    <p>
                        This will bring up a table where you can add, edit or remove party members.The party window has fields for level, perception, AC and other metrics. Add a
                        party member and mark them as active with the checkbox. You can also choose a token for the PC here. This token will be used in the Maptool.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A plaque with the Player Character's key metrics now appears in the main app screen. Pressing the horizontal arrows will switch between alternative AC and
                        regular AC (with or without a shield, for instance). Pressing the up or down arrows will apply a buff/debuff to armor, useful if the PC has a Shield of
                        Faith effect for instance.

                    <p>
                        If the party icon is white, it means that the player is not assigned to any specific party. Press it, and you will see an input field. Write the party name
                        and press enter. This can be an existing party or a new one. You can now filter by this party in the filter input, on top of the table. This is useful if
                        you DM for multiple parties.

                        You can randomly generate level appropriate encounters for your party, if you have saved the party in the Party window. The encounter randomizer will use
                        the level of your currently active Player characters to generate encounters.

                    <p>
                        In the randomizer tool, start typing "Encounters:". A list of suggestions will then appear. You can genearte an encounter from anything in the monster
                        manual, or you can choose a subset based on creature type.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can add more constraints, such as the approximate number of creatures in the encounter and the approximate difficulty of the encounter. Once the
                        encounter is generated, you can load it into the combat panel like a normal encounter. (See
                        <button class="hyperlink_like" onclick="setDrawer(1)">The basics</button>)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note that it's possible that the Encounter randomizer will not come up with anything. If that's the case, then the constraints are too narrow, if for
                        example you attempt to create an easy encounter of celestials for a level 1 party (Given that you haven't added any homebrew celestial creatures).

                        You can create tables for special types of encounters, just like encounters based on creature type. You might for example, create an encounter set named
                        "Highwaymen", which would include bandits and other humanoid NPC's.

                        You can now create a simple table of creatures that the will be randomly chosen when generating a random encounter. Once you save this table, you will be
                        able to randomly generate encounters via the the Randomizer in the main app screen. In the case of the Highwaymen example, you would type "Encounter:
                        Highwaymen".

                        The dump input is to quickly generate a set from another source, such as Excel. You can paste from any source where entries in the set are seperated by a

                    <h2>Random tables</h2>

                    <img src="screenshots/4.8.jpg" class="img_right" alt="Creating a random table named 'Trinkets'." />
                    <p>
                        You can create random tables to roll from using the Randomizer tool. Start by opening the Customize tab in the Generate window. Choose "Random Tables" from
                        the drop down menu. Start by typing the table name (fig. 1), and press enter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The dump input (fig. 2)is for quickly generating tables from another source. You can paste text into it and generate a random table from that. New lines
                        represent new rows and tab characters represent new columns. A copied table from Excel will have this format.
                    </p>
                    <p>Each row represents one entry in the table. The title (fig. 3) and content (fig. 4) columns are simply textual.</p>
                    <p>
                        The percentage (fig. 5) column represents the probability of a that entry being picked. Thus if the first row has a percentage column of 2, and all the
                        other rows have a precentage column of 1, the probability of the first row being picked is double that of the others. <br /><br />
                        Note that it does not matter how high the numbers are in the percentage column, as they are normalized when the table is rolled. Thus if the first row has a
                        percentage column of 200 and the others have 100, the first row is still twice as likely to be picked as the others. <br />The percentage column has a
                        default of 1.
                        <img src="screenshots/4.9.jpg" class="img_right" alt="Linking a your table with another table named 'Trinkets'." />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can link tables together using the Roll again on column. Type the name of an existing table and if that entry is rolled for the Randomizer will roll
                        again on that table. If you've already created the table a list of autofill suggestions will pop up. Note that if you have not, you must write the table
                        name correctly. If the Roll again column is filled out whatever is written in the title and content columns will be ignored.

                        In the Shops tab of the Generator window you can randomly generate magical shops. You can generate a shop of particular type (fig. 1), wealth level (fig.
                        2), size (fig. 3) and change the general pricing of the shop's items (fig. 4).

                    <p>
                        A shop will be generated with a description, owner and inventory. If you don't like the inventory generated you can generate another set of inventory
                        without changing the description (fig. 5).
                    </p>
                    <p>You can see descriptions of the items for sale by hovering over the table. (fig. 6)</p>

                <p>
                    You can add things to the database. In the Database window, accessible via the main app screen, you can select a category (spells, items, homebrew monsters,
                    etc) and add or delete entries to that cateogry.

                        To add a homebrew monster, select the + in the top left corner of the homebrew monster list. A form will appear where you fill out the information for the
                        monster. Most fields are optional but fields which are used by the Map tool (Size) and the Combat panel (Hit points, AC) should be filled out to avoid
                        unpredictable behavior

                    <p>
                        Each creature is saved by name, so you cannot save two creatures with the same name. Any field that's left empty will not be saved, if the "Amphibious"
                        Special Ability is left blank, the creature will not have that ability.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can use markdown to style any of the fields.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Challenge rating calculator gives you an estimated CR of the creature. Defensive CR is calculated from AC and HP, but you must input predicted damage
                        per round and main attack bonus to calculate the offensive CR. Note this is just an estimate.
                    </p>

                    <p>Once you save the entry, you can search for it in the main app screen and load it into the Combat panel as with creatures from the SRD.</p>

                    <p>
                        An encounter has a name, description and creature list. The creature list has an autocomplete feature, and if a creature with a given name is in the
                        database the Challenge rating field will automatically be filled out. It can also be manually changed, if the creature named is not in the database.

                    <p>
                        The difficulty calculator will estimate an encounter's difficulty. It either uses the levels of all Player characters that are marked as active in the Party
                        window of the main app screen, or you can manually input the level and party size.
                    </p>
