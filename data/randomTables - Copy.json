The wisps will attempt to cover the door so they are unable to leave the mill.

The alchemical table contains a journal, which depict the attempts of the alchemist Maren Torver to save her companions from petrificiation. The notes include a recipe for the her results, burned cockatrice feathers mixed with basilisk blood.  A revised recipe calls for Torren Root, instead of the feathers. If the scene is disturbed, 1d4 of the statues will sneak up on the party and attack, as they are Stone cursed. Maren's skeleton can be glimpsed in a small alcove close to the alchemy tables.",
